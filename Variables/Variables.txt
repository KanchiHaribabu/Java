Variables:-

Variable is the container which holds user data.
 Memory will be allocated for the variable while executing the program.
 Value of the variable can be changed any number of times during the program execution.

Syntax:

<Data type> <varName>;

<Data type> <varName> = <value>;

Types of Variables

There are two types of variables based on data type used to declare the variable.
1) Primitive Variables
2) Reference Variables 

1)Primitive Variables:
	Variables declared with primitive data types are called as primitive variables.

Ex:
int a;
int b = 99;
double d1;
double d2=9.9;

2)Reference Variables:-
	Variables declared with user defined data types are called as reference variables.

Ex:
String str1;
String str2 = “JLC”; 

Types of Variables:-

There are three types of variables based on the scope of the variables.

1) Instance Variables
2) Static Variables
3) Local Variables

1) Instance Variables :

 Variables declared in the class without using static keyword are called as Instance variables.

2) Static Variables

 Variables declared in the class using static keyword are called as Static variables.

3) Local Variables

 Variables declared in the member of the class like method etc are called as Local variables.

Syntax:-

class Hello{
            int a;            ----------> Instance Variable
  static int b;            --------> Static Variable
void show(){
     int c = 30;             ----------> Local Variable
}
}
